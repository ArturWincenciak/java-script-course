# Java Script Learning Repository

This repo is my playground for learning JavaScript. I’m working through the course 
"**[Praktyczny kurs JavaScript od podstaw](https://www.udemy.com/course/praktyczny-kurs-javascript/)**" 
available on Udemy. The goal is to dive deep into JavaScript fundamentals, learn how to build interactive websites, 
and master key JavaScript concepts.

In this course, you'll get a solid understanding of JavaScript, 
from basic syntax to more advanced features. 
Here’s a quick look at what you can expect:

- **Basics of JavaScript**: Learn about variables, data types, and functions.
- **Working with Numbers & Strings**: Understand how to manipulate numbers and work with strings.
- **Arrays and Objects**: Learn how to store and organize data efficiently.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Master loops like `for`, `while`, and `for-of` to automate repetitive tasks and make decisions in code.
- **Debugging**: Learn how to fix bugs and optimize your code.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and responsive web pages.
- **Handling User Events**: Create user-friendly interfaces that respond to clicks, keypresses, and more.
- **Async Programming**: Understand how to handle asynchronous tasks with `async` and `await`.
- **Working with REST APIs**: Learn how to fetch data from external sources and send data back to a server.
